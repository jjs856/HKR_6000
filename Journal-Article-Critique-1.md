### Journal Article Critique 1 (8%)

1. Select one (1) of the three articles available on D2L for your critique.
2. Read the corresponding journal article.
3. Develop (~800 word, not including the title page or references) critique of methods, design, and statistical analysis of a study. 
    * The critique can be point form or short paragraphs 
    * Include a title page (including your name and stating the word count of your
    * Include citations and a page of references formatted in any journal format (APA, AMA)
    * Resources are available on D2L. You will find two student examples (including my feedback to the students).
    * Submit your critique and the journal article to the `Journal Critique 1` dropbox.

#### Content
1. The content of your critique is determined by: 
    * The specific journal article
    * What you feel comfortable critiquing. 
 
#### General critique 
1. Methodological issues regarding quantitative measurement (e.g., Are variables clearly conceptualized/defined? Do you agree with their conceptualization/definitions, why or why not? Were the measurement for all variables (operationalization) clearly stated? Are the measures valid and reliable (was this reported)? Do you agree with the measures chosen, why or why not?).
2. Sampling technique. What sampling technique was used for the study? Did the author(s) report the technique or did you have to decipher? What recruitment strategies were used? How would the sampling technique or sample selected influence the reliability or validity of the study?
3. The strength of a critique is always enhanced when you provide citations to back up your statements. At minimum, you can reference your class readings for methodological issues and for statistical issues you can reference the textbook (or look at the citations that Field provides). Thus, A papers will include citations (i.e., if citations are not provided a B+ is the highest possible grade to receive).
4. A good critique provides a fair balance of limitations as well as positive aspects of an article/study. If one only receives negative feedback one will not know what one is doing well/correctly? This balance of positive/negatives does need to be equal (although it can be); for example and you may have more emphasis on limitations (60-75%) then strengths (25-40%).

#### Written Critique Evaluation
* Addressing the required critique content focus (i.e., quantitative measurement and sampling technique)
* Balance of critique in terms of including both strengths and limitations.
* Critical thinking which includes the following
    * points of discussion are clearly stated
    * points of discussion are clearly explained (i.e., why it is a strength or limitation)
    * suggestions for improvement or future research are provided for points of limitations of the article. Critical thinking is often demonstrated in thoughtfulness as well as rationale (which are enhanced with citations/references).
* Your use of research terminology (methods and statistical). It is expected that you use concepts and terms learned in the course lectures and course readings. In particular I will be looking at whether terminology was used correctly; used appropriately; and whether use of research terminology aided to the clarity of the critique. As the course progresses you should be developing a larger understanding of the language of research; thus, it is expected that your use of research language in your journal article critiques will greater in the second critique.
* Writing style will NOT be evaluated. However, marks will be deducted if there are major spelling or grammatical errors or other typo errors.

#### Guiding questions

##### Introduction
* Why do we care about this area of research?
* What are hypotheses? Why do the authors expect their hypotheses to be supported?
* What is the basis for their predictions?
* How does the study fit in with existing work? If it cures a weakness in previous research,
what was wrong with previous research? If it extends or fills a gap in previous research,
what is that gap?
* What variables are they looking at?
* Do I agree with their arguments?
* Does the hypothesis really follow from theory or previous research?

##### Method
* Who were the participants? 
* How were they obtained? 
* What was done to the participants?
* What was the independent variable(s)?
* How were the participants treated?
* What did participants do?
* What was the dependent variable?
* What was the design?
* Are there reasons to expect that results from these participants are atypical? Might they have
gotten different results with a different subject population? Were groups equivalent
before the study began? Were there enough participants?
* Are there any other variables that should have been controlled or examined?
* Do they have adequate control groups?
* Are there any confounding variables?
* Would it have been better to use different operational definitions?
* Did the measure have adequate reliability?
* Was this the best design for the problem or would you have used a different one? 
* Are the operational definitions appropriate?

##### Results
* How are they deriving the scores that they put into the analysis? That is, how are they scoring participants' responses?
* How do they make numbers out of the participants' behaviour?
* What are the average scores for the different groups?
* Do the statistics directly test the predictions made in the introduction?
* Do the statistical tests match up with the verbal descriptions? That is, if the authors say
that Group 1 scored better than Group 2, do they have an analysis that directly compares
Group 1 against Group 2?
* Is the choice of analysis appropriate?
* Does the data justify the interpretation of the results?

##### Conclusion and Discussion
* Do they think the results matched their predictions? How do they explain any discrepancies?
* What additional studies do they recommend?
* What questions do I have?
* Are there other explanations for the results, such as hypothesis guessing or competing theories?
* Are there additional studies I would recommend?
* Did the authors state something that was not supported by the results? For
example, do they treat a nonsignificant or talk about a comparison that was not made?
* Think about the theory used. Do you agree? If not, why not? Do you like the article? Just saying that you don't like it, or that it doesn't work for you is not enough -- it may be a
good starting point, but you need to know why! Look for false assumptions (stated or
unstated). Look for erroneous reasoning.
* Look at the conclusions and see if they follow logically from the data. One thing to look
for is whether they ignore part of their data. A second thing is to see if they have over- explained the findings: In other words are there other, more simple explanations.
