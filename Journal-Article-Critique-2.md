### Journal Article Critique 2 (10%)
1. Select any research journal article of your choice that uses an experimental design OR survey research.
2. Read the corresponding journal article.
3. Develop (~1200 word, not including the title page or references) critique of methods, design, and statistical analysis of a study. 
    * Include a title page (including your name and stating the word count of your
    * Include citations and a page of references formatted in any journal format (APA, AMA)
    * Resources are available on D2L. You will find two student examples (including my feedback to the students).
    * Submit your critique and the journal article to the `Journal Critique 2` dropbox.

#### Content
1. The content of your critique is determined by: 
    * The specific journal article
    * What you feel comfortable critiquing. 
    
    
Below you will find some guiding questions to help you develop your critique. Please note that you DO NOT need to answer all of these questions (and probably shouldn’t because you would not have enough depth or detail to your critique). For example, you may only answer 3-5 questions depending on how much detail you provide.

#### Critique 
1. The focus should be a general critique of the entire article/study along with critique in specific methodological and statistical issues. The following are specific content that could be included in the critique:
    * Reliability/Methodological issues regarding quantitative measurement (e.g., Are variables clearly conceptualized/defined? Do you agree with their conceptualization/definitions, why or why not? Were the measurement for all variables (operationalization) clearly stated? Are the measures valid and reliable (was this reported)? Do you agree with the measures chosen, why or why not?).
    * External validity (What aspects of the study increase external validity, why? What aspects of the study decrease external validity, why?).
    * Internal validity (What aspects of the study increase its internal validity, why? What aspects of the study decrease its internal validity, why?).
    * Statistical analysis (e.g., Did authors state if they explored normality of the data? Were statistical assumptions of tests explored investigated? Is sufficient detail provided? Do you think they utilized to correct test? Are the results clear?).
2. The strength of a critique is always enhanced when you provide citations to back up your statements. At minimum, you can reference your class readings for methodological issues and for statistical issues you can reference the textbook (or look at the citations that Field provides). Thus, A papers will include citations (i.e., if citations are not provided a B+ is the highest possible grade to receive).
3. A good critique provides a fair balance of limitations as well as positive aspects of an article/study. If one only receives negative feedback one will not know what one is doing well/correctly? This balance of positive/negatives does need to be equal (although it can be); for example and you may have more emphasis on limitations (60-75%) then strengths (25-40%).
4. You should assume that the reader has read the article you are critiquing. Thus, summary of the article/significance should not be too long. This introduction/summary of study to the critique should be about 1⁄2-3⁄4 of a page. Obviously you will also provide study details in the remainder of the paper to provide details/context for your critique. However, the focus should be on providing critique (strengths and limitations) of the study. If you provide too much summary of the study, then you are not really focusing on critiquing the study. I looking for YOUR thoughts on the study – not your ability provide a summary.

#### Evaluation

1. Critique (80% of total assignment grade) will be evaluated in terms of: Addressing the required critique content focus (i.e., reliability/quantitative measurement; external validity; internal validity; statistical analysis).
Balance of critique in terms of including both strengths and limitations.
Critical thinking which includes the following: 
    * points of discussion are clearly stated
    * points of discussion are clearly explained (i.e., why it is a strength or limitation)
    * suggestions for improvement or future research are provided for points of limitations of the article. Critical thinking is often demonstrated in thoughtfulness as well as rationale (which are enhanced with citations/references). Your use of supporting citations/references for methodological and statistical statements.
    * Your use of research terminology (methods and statistical). It is expected that you use concepts and terms learned in the course lectures and course readings. In particular I will be looking at whether terminology was used correctly; used appropriately; and whether use of research terminology aided to the clarity of the critique.
    
2. Writing Style, Organization and Formatting (20% of total assignment grade) will be evaluated in terms of:
    * Following formatting guidelines including word count.
    * Formatting of citations and referencing style.
    * Organization: logical structure; sophisticated transitional sentences; clear headings d. Spelling & grammar - grammar and usage are correct and contribute to clarity and
style; spelling errors; typos)
    * Writing style - appropriate word choice in terms of meaning; sentence style fits
paper's audience and purpose; sentences are varied, yet clearly structured and carefully focused and not long and rambling


#### Guiding questions

##### Introduction
* Why do we care about this area of research?
* What are hypotheses? Why do the authors expect their hypotheses to be supported?
* What is the basis for their predictions?
* How does the study fit in with existing work? If it cures a weakness in previous research,
what was wrong with previous research? If it extends or fills a gap in previous research,
what is that gap?
* What variables are they looking at?
* Do I agree with their arguments?
* Does the hypothesis really follow from theory or previous research?

##### Method
* Who were the participants? 
* How were they obtained? 
* What was done to the participants?
* What was the independent variable(s)?
* How were the participants treated?
* What did participants do?
* What was the dependent variable?
* What was the design?
* Are there reasons to expect that results from these participants are atypical? Might they have
gotten different results with a different subject population? Were groups equivalent
before the study began? Were there enough participants?
* Are there any other variables that should have been controlled or examined?
* Do they have adequate control groups?
* Are there any confounding variables?
* Would it have been better to use different operational definitions?
* Did the measure have adequate reliability?
* Was this the best design for the problem or would you have used a different one? 
* Are the operational definitions appropriate?

##### Results
* How are they deriving the scores that they put into the analysis? That is, how are they scoring participants' responses?
* How do they make numbers out of the participants' behaviour?
* What are the average scores for the different groups?
* Do the statistics directly test the predictions made in the introduction?
* Do the statistical tests match up with the verbal descriptions? That is, if the authors say
that Group 1 scored better than Group 2, do they have an analysis that directly compares
Group 1 against Group 2?
* Is the choice of analysis appropriate?
* Does the data justify the interpretation of the results?

##### Conclusion and Discussion
* Do they think the results matched their predictions? How do they explain any discrepancies?
* What additional studies do they recommend?
* What questions do I have?
* Are there other explanations for the results, such as hypothesis guessing or competing theories?
* Are there additional studies I would recommend?
* Did the authors state something that was not supported by the results? For
example, do they treat a nonsignificant or talk about a comparison that was not made?
* Think about the theory used. Do you agree? If not, why not? Do you like the article? Just saying that you don't like it, or that it doesn't work for you is not enough -- it may be a
good starting point, but you need to know why! Look for false assumptions (stated or
unstated). Look for erroneous reasoning.
* Look at the conclusions and see if they follow logically from the data. One thing to look
for is whether they ignore part of their data. A second thing is to see if they have over- explained the findings: In other words are there other, more simple explanations.
